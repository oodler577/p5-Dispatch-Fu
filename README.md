# Dispatch::Fu

`Dispatch::Fu` is a small, production-worthy Perl module intended for production use. It turns arbitrary
input into a static dispatch key and then using that key to select a handler
from a hash-based dispatch table.

It is intended for situations where ordinary hash dispatch is attractive, but
the value that determines the action is not already a convenient one-to-one
hash key. The `dispatch` block performs whatever classification or reduction
your application needs; the resulting static key is matched to a handler
registered with `on`.

The implementation is deliberately lightweight. Runtime dependencies are
limited to Perl core modules, and the public interface stays focused on five
routines:

- `dispatch` — compute a key and invoke the corresponding handler.
- `on` — register a static key/handler pair for a dispatch operation.
- `cases` — inspect the currently registered case names.
- `xdefault` — return a case name when it exists, otherwise a default key.
- `xshift_and_deref` — shift and dereference common reference types in one step.

The distribution includes regression tests for repeated dispatch, case
introspection, default handling, diagnostics, return-value behavior, reference
unpacking, invalid handlers, and false-but-valid dispatch keys.

## Example

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Dispatch::Fu;    # exports dispatch, on, cases, xdefault, xshift_and_deref

my $input = [qw/1 2 3 4 5/];

my $result = dispatch {
    my $values = shift;

    return scalar(@$values) > 5
      ? q{bucket5}
      : sprintf q{bucket%d}, scalar @$values;
}
$input,
  on bucket0 => sub { return q{bucket 0} },
  on bucket1 => sub { return q{bucket 1} },
  on bucket2 => sub { return q{bucket 2} },
  on bucket3 => sub { return q{bucket 3} },
  on bucket4 => sub { return q{bucket 4} },
  on bucket5 => sub { return q{bucket 5} };

print "$result\n";    # bucket 5
```

The dispatch block is ordinary Perl. It can classify a range, inspect multiple
values stored in a reference, normalize external input, apply application
rules, or perform any other deterministic reduction that produces one of the
registered keys.

## Why use Dispatch::Fu?

A conventional Perl dispatch table is concise and fast when the decision is
already represented by a static string:

```perl
my $handlers = {
    start => sub { ... },
    stop  => sub { ... },
};

$handlers->{$action}->();
```

`Dispatch::Fu` keeps that simple final lookup while adding an explicit stage for
computing the key. This makes it useful for cases traditionally expressed as
long `if`/`elsif` chains, switch/case constructs, `given`/`when`, smartmatch
logic, or other ad hoc classification code.

```perl
my $result = dispatch {
    my $value = shift;

    return q{small}  if $value < 10;
    return q{medium} if $value < 100;
    return q{large};
}
$value,
  on small  => sub { ... },
  on medium => sub { ... },
  on large  => sub { ... };
```

## Defaults and introspection

`xdefault` is a shortcut for the common case where an input value should be
used directly when it names a registered case:

```perl
my $result = dispatch {
    xdefault shift;
}
$action,
  on default => sub { ... },
  on start   => sub { ... },
  on stop    => sub { ... };
```

`cases` returns the currently registered case names and can be used while
computing a dispatch key when application logic needs to inspect the available
choices.

## Reference unpacking

`dispatch` passes one scalar value to the classification block and selected
handler. When that scalar is a reference, `xshift_and_deref` can remove common
unpacking boilerplate:

```perl
my ($x, $y, $z) = xshift_and_deref @_;
```

It supports hash, array, and scalar references.

## Diagnostics

`Dispatch::Fu` detects common dispatch mistakes and reports them clearly. It
croaks when no cases are supplied, croaks when the computed key does not map to
a CODE handler, and warns when `on` is accidentally used in void or scalar
context (a common sign that a semicolon was used where a comma was intended).

## Stability

`Dispatch::Fu` is maintained as production code rather than a proof of concept.
The module intentionally keeps a small API and implementation surface, and
changes should preserve existing calling conventions and lightweight runtime
requirements. See `Changes` for release history and `t/` for executable usage
examples and regression coverage.
